// attach_default.go — the default-on attach decision helper (resilient-attach
// arc, WP-C).
//
// `observer claude` / `observer codex` attach to the running daemon's PTY by
// DEFAULT when it is safe to do so (config [terminal.attach].default_on, TRUE by
// default), so a live session shows up on the dashboard with no extra flag. The
// operator opts out per-launch with `--no-attach`; `--attach` still FORCES
// attach (a no-op when the default already applies, never an error merely for
// being redundant). When default-on attach is wanted but the daemon socket is
// unreachable, the launcher prints ONE stderr notice and FALLS BACK to the
// normal bare launch with exit codes preserved — it never refuses, never
// silently drops the launch.
//
// The decision itself is a PURE, table-driven helper (decideAttach): all inputs
// are injected — no config load, no TTY probe, no socket dial happens inside it
// (repo discipline: decision logic is a data table walked top-down, one row per
// case). The launchers compute the inputs (config flags, capability grounding,
// TTY-ness, incompatible-mode, and a lazily-invoked reachability closure) and
// act on the verdict.

// Rows 0/0b are FIRST so a daemon-owned launcher never re-attaches regardless of
// any flag — attaching there would dial the daemon and recurse into an unbounded
// spawn loop. They split by the live-OOB signal for NOTICE purposes only (the
// anti-recursion verdict is identical — both bare):
//   - Row 0 (daemonSpawned, a live trusted OOB channel) is the daemon's OWN inner
//     launcher — the normal, high-frequency attach path. THIS process's stderr IS
//     the user's attached PTY, so a notice here would print "attach skipped" at
//     the top of every attached session and mislead (attach DID happen, at the
//     outer launcher). Checked FIRST and kept SILENT.
//   - Row 0b (the OBSERVER_DAEMON_CHILD env marker present but NO live OOB
//     channel) is a user manually running `observer <tool>` from a shell INSIDE a
//     daemon-owned PTY (the child inherits the marker), or, rarely, an inner
//     launcher whose OOB auth died. That is the genuine "I expected attach, why
//     bare?" surprise → NOTICE — but ONLY on an interactive launch that did not
//     also opt out or run in an incompatible/non-TTY mode (finding 5): a
//     daemon-child + --no-attach / --print / CI-pipe is a scripted path where the
//     notice would be spam, so it stays SILENT there (verdict still bare). The env
//     marker still infallibly forces bare here even when daemonSpawned is false,
//     so anti-recursion is unchanged.
//
// Row 3 keeps BOTH the incompatible-mode and the non-TTY launch SILENT: an
// incompatible mode is a mode the user chose, and a non-TTY stdin/stdout is the
// near-certain signature of a script or pipe (the `observer <tool> -- --print`
// wrapper, CI, `observer run`) where a stray stderr line is the top regression
// risk. We deliberately do NOT try to notice an "interactive-looking non-TTY"
// launch: non-TTY IS the scripting signal and there is no clean way to separate a
// piped-but-interactive launch from a scripted one, so silence is the safe error.
//
// Rows 4/5/6 are reached only after row 3 filtered out non-interactive and
// incompatible launches, so both-TTY + compatible is already guaranteed. Row 6
// fires only when the prior row's `enabled` was false (else row 4/5 matched), so
// `default_on && grounded` here is exactly the enabled=false/default_on=true
// config contradiction — named explicitly so the operator can fix it rather than
