// codex_discover.go — daemon-spawned codex session discovery + OOB announce
// (session-attach design Phase 2 / P2-1).
//
// Codex CLI (0.144.x checked) has NO caller-choosable session id: there is no
// `--session-id` flag on a fresh or `exec` launch, and only `resume`/`fork`
// accept an EXISTING id. So a daemon-spawned attach/fresh `observer codex`
// launch cannot FORCE a known id up front the way `observer claude` does
// (claude.go::forceClaudeSessionID). Instead, this file DISCOVERS the session:
// after the child starts, it watches $CODEX_HOME/sessions for the NEW rollout
// codex writes for THIS run, reads only that file's leading session_meta line to
// extract the real session id (and cwd for corroboration), and announces the id
// on the trusted out-of-band launcher channel (announceOOBSession →
// termoob.TypeSession) so the daemon correlates the run to its dashboard
// session.
//
// Honesty via abstention (design intent — "honest about weaker evidence"):
// discovery is a weaker signal than claude's forced id (we infer the id from
// the filesystem rather than dictating it), so the matcher NEVER guesses. It
// announces only a SINGLE new rollout, corroborated by cwd when the meta line
// carries one, confirmed on two consecutive polls (to catch a racing concurrent
// session); ANY ambiguity (two or more new rollouts) makes it announce nothing.
// The announced id rides the same trusted OOB frame as claude's, so the daemon
// records it at oob confidence (the frame→source mapping is owned by the
// launcher-side drain and is intentionally not touched here); the strict
// abstention gate is what keeps that honest.

//
// Why observe the whole window before announcing (R2-1): codex writes its
// session_meta at session start, but an UNRELATED concurrent codex process
// (a second fresh/resumed session in the same project) can race ahead and write
// its same-cwd rollout FIRST, before this run's file appears. A mid-window
// announce (the pre-fix behaviour, which fired after a candidate survived two
// polls) could lock onto that unrelated id at ~0.75s and return before this
// run's own — or a genuinely-second — candidate ever showed up, making a later
// abstention impossible. Deferring the decision to window close means a second
// candidate that appears at ANY point in the window still forces abstention
// (the never-guess rule). The honest price is latency: the correlation badge
// lights up ~30s after launch rather than sub-second.
//
// Candidates are accumulated across polls (keyed by session id, preferring a
// poll that read a non-empty cwd) rather than trusting a single final scan, so a
// candidate whose meta was briefly unreadable still counts toward ambiguity.
//
// It does NOT close the window early on any signal short of ctx cancellation:
// no signal here can guarantee a second candidate cannot appear later, so
// (per the never-invent-an-early-close rule) it just waits the window. On ctx
// cancellation (the caller cancels when the child exits) it returns WITHOUT
// announcing — a short-lived run legitimately forgoes discovery correlation
// rather than risk announcing a same-cwd id that only looked unique because the
