// proxy_fallback.go — the pure, table-driven launch-time decision every tool
// launcher (`observer claude`, `observer codex`) consults before a bare launch
// to answer ONE question honestly: given the user's routing intent, whether the
// observer proxy is reachable, and whether the TOOL'S OWN persistent config
// bakes in a proxy route, should this launch (a) proceed routed through the
// proxy, (b) launch bypassing the proxy, or (c) refuse?
//
// Why this exists (resilient-attach scenario 4/5 + codex-parity):
// Claude Code's settings.json `env` block OVERRIDES the process environment
// (docs "How scopes interact" + the `env` description "Set a variable to `""` to
// override a shell export"; empirically confirmed 2026-07-20). Codex 0.130+
// likewise reads $CODEX_HOME/config.toml and silently drops the wrapper's argv
// `-c openai_base_url` override (V6-2). So when `observer init` bakes a proxy
// route into the tool's OWN persistent config, the launcher CANNOT neutralize it
// by touching the process env / argv — the tool reads its own config and keeps
// routing to the observer proxy. If that proxy is DOWN (the daemon-unreachable
// attach fallback, or a plain launch with the daemon stopped), every API call
// hits a dead proxy and the session is silently broken — the exact operator
// report the "notice + bare launch" fallback failed to honor.
//
// The decision is a pure function of THREE capability-shaped facts (never the
// tool name — CLAUDE.md #3): the user's no-proxy-route intent, proxy
// reachability, and whether the tool's persistent config routes to the proxy.
// Detection of the persistent route is per-tool I/O performed at the boundary
// (claudeConfigRoutesToProxy reads settings.json; codexConfigsRoutingToProxy
// reads config.toml) and injected here as a plain bool, so this function does no
// I/O and is exhaustively table-tested (CLAUDE.md #1/#5).

// proxyFallbackAction is what the launcher should do with the launch.

	// a persistent config route would keep routing anyway (the escape hatch is a

// decideProxyFallback is the pure, table-driven launch-time routing decision.
// The pivotal fact is `blocking`: a persistent config route the launcher CANNOT
// override (persistentRoute && !canNeutralizePersistent). A blocking route is
// the only thing that forces a fail-closed; a route the launcher CAN override
// (or the absence of a route) always neutralizes or proceeds. Rows walked
// top-down; first match wins:
//
//  1. --no-proxy-route  &&  blocking route         → FAIL CLOSED  (escape-hatch lie, can't override)
//  2. --no-proxy-route  && !blocking               → neutralize   (bypass; override the route if any)
//  3. routed            &&  proxy reachable         → proceed      (happy path)
//  4. routed && !reachable &&  blocking route       → FAIL CLOSED  (dead baked-in proxy, can't override)
//  5. routed && !reachable && !blocking             → neutralize   (working daemon-down fallback)
//
// Row 1 is FIRST and independent of proxy reachability: an un-overridable route
// the tool applies over the launcher's bypass makes the `--no-proxy-route`
// promise false whether the proxy is up (turns captured against the user's wish)
// or down (dead-proxy break) — the honest move is to refuse and name the fix,
// exactly like codex's B3-1 guard. Rows 4/5 are the routed daemon-down split:
// refuse when a baked-in route the launcher can't override would silently send
// API calls into a dead proxy, else neutralize (operator decision #2 — notice +
// working launch). When canNeutralizePersistent is true (claude's `--settings`
// override lever), `blocking` collapses to false, so a claude launch with a
// baked-in route NEUTRALIZES via the override instead of refusing; codex passes
// canNeutralizePersistent=false, so its persistent-route rows stay fail-closed.
