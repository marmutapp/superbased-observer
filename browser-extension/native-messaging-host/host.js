// host.js — native-messaging stdio host for the SuperBased Observer browser
// extension (Phase 1).
//
// The browser launches this process and speaks Chrome's native-messaging wire
// protocol over stdio: each message is a 4-byte little-endian uint32 length
// prefix followed by that many bytes of UTF-8 JSON. For every captured-turn
// message the browser sends, this host invokes
//   observer browser hook <event>
// with the payload JSON on the child's STDIN — the same landing point the
// loopback listener funnels into. The <event> is "health" for a health
// beacon (payload.type === "health") and "capture" for every other message.
// It then replies (framed) — see the reply-after-exit contract below — so the
// extension's sendNativeMessage callback resolves. A successful ingest replies
// {status:"ok"}; a spawn failure / non-zero child exit / kill signal replies a
// bounded {status:"error", ...} so the extension's non-ok warning path fires.
//
// NOTE: this file has a byte-identical twin. The two copies are
//   internal/browserhost/hostfiles/host.js         (the go:embed SHIPPED copy,
//                                                    written by `observer init
//                                                    --browser`)
//   browser-extension/native-messaging-host/host.js (the standalone repo copy)
// A Go test (internal/browserhost/browserhost_test.go::TestHostFilesByteIdentical)
// byte-compares them, so they can never drift. Edit BOTH, identically, or the
// test fails.
//
// REPLY-AFTER-EXIT CONTRACT (fire-and-forget events only — "capture" and
// "health", i.e. every payload EXCEPT type:"config"): the host DEFERS its
// reply until the spawned `observer browser hook` child has EXITED (its
// payload written to stdin and stdin closed FIRST, as before). This is
// load-bearing on the Windows→WSL bridge. Chrome's sendNativeMessage is
// one-shot: it tears the native host down the instant the reply resolves.
// On Linux-native Chrome that kills only THIS node process and the observer
// grandchild survives to finish its DB write — so the old immediate ack was
// fine. But over the Windows bridge (Chrome → .bat → wsl.exe →
// host-launcher.sh → this host) Chrome's job-object teardown kills
// cmd.exe + wsl.exe, and the wsl.exe death terminates the whole WSL-side
// session — INCLUDING the just-spawned observer child, so the ingest dies
// mid-flight and the turn is lost with ZERO drop telemetry (the child dies
// before it can write health.json). Holding the reply until the child exits
// keeps Chrome — and therefore the wsl.exe relay and the WSL-side child —
// alive until the ingest is durable.
//
// Safety cap: if the child hasn't exited within HOST_INGEST_CAP_MS (40s) the
// host replies {status:"ok"} anyway and leaves the child running — worst case
// is exactly the old fire-and-forget behavior; the host must never hang Chrome
// forever. That cap MUST exceed the daemon's end-to-end Go ingest bound; see
// HOST_INGEST_CAP_MS below for the cross-reference that keeps them in sync.
//
// Because the reply is deferred, frames are processed SERIALLY: the host
// awaits one frame's reply — WRITTEN AND FLUSHED — before reading the next
// from the stdin buffer, so any queued frame (rare — sendNativeMessage is one
// host per message, but the buffer loop stays defensive) still replies IN
// ORDER, and the process never exits with a reply half-written (see
// writeMessage / maybeExit — a forced process.exit() would truncate a pending
// pipe write and Chrome would see a disconnected host instead of the ack).
//
// A config REQUEST (payload.type === "config") is the exception to the fire-
// and-forget shape: the host spawns `observer browser hook config`, captures
// its single JSON stdout line (the daemon's effective browser policy), and
// replies with THAT instead of {status:"ok"} — this is how the extension
// follows the daemon's configured granularity ceiling with no user config.
//
// The observer binary is resolved from the OBSERVER_BIN env var (set in the
// host launcher or the environment); it defaults to "observer" on PATH. An
// optional OBSERVER_CONFIG env var is forwarded as --config so the hook writes
// to the same observer.db the daemon uses.
//
// This host never crashes on a bad message or a torn pipe: parse/spawn errors
// are logged to stderr (which the browser surfaces in the extension's
// native-messaging error) and the loop continues; async stream errors (an
// EPIPE when Chrome or the Go child tears its end down) are caught and settled
// through the same exactly-once path rather than thrown.
