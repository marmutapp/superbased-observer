	// it, or how many times they repeated it; every other requested kind
	// is also deduped (first occurrence wins) but otherwise keeps the
	// caller's relative order. There is no supported way to produce a

// Render turns an Input, a DaemonTile, and a RenderOptions into EXACTLY
// ONE line of text — no trailing newline, and (F1 fix) no embedded
// control character of any kind: no CR, no LF, no other C0/C1 control,
// no DEL. The caller (cmd/observer/statusline.go) owns terminating the
// line when it writes to stdout; Render's job stops at producing the
// bytes a Claude Code statusLine command is expected to print verbatim
// — and a statusLine command that ever emits a newline or a raw escape
// byte corrupts the host's own status render, the single worst failure
// mode this command can produce (plan §2.3 point 6).
//
// Render first normalizes opts.Segments via normalizeSegments (F12: the
// wordmark is forced present exactly once at the front; every other kind
// is deduped, order otherwise preserved). It then walks the normalized
// list; for each kind it asks the matching per-segment renderer in
// segments.go for a (text, ok) pair. A segment whose datum is absent is
// OMITTED entirely — never rendered as a fabricated "$0.00" or empty
// model name (plan §4.1). Because normalization guarantees the wordmark
// is always present, the maximally degraded composition (no daemon, no
// stdin JSON, or every other requested segment's datum absent) is the
// wordmark alone — a fully empty rendered line is no longer possible.
//
// Every externally-sourced segment (currently: the model name,
// segments.go's renderModelSegment / modelName) is sanitized at the
// point it's read out of Input (sanitizeControls, sanitize.go) — that is
// the primary fix for F1. As defense in depth, Render ALSO hard-strips
// any control rune from the fully-composed, not-yet-colorized line
// before returning it, so the "no control rune reaches stdout" invariant
// holds even for a future segment kind that forgets to sanitize its own
// input. Color wrapping happens LAST, strictly after that hard-strip
// pass, and wraps only the wordmark's own known-safe leading text
// (colorizeWordmarkPrefix) — so the ANSI bytes Render itself legitimately
// emits when Color is true are added only after every control byte from
// caller-supplied text has already been stripped, and no caller-supplied
// text is ever mistaken for part of that trusted sequence.
//
// Every segment after the wordmark joins to its predecessor with " · ".
// The wordmark itself is special-cased in joinSegments: if Wordmark's
// own text already ends in the separator glyph ("·"), it joins to
// whatever follows with a single plain space instead, so the glyph isn't
// doubled (e.g. a provisional "sb·" candidate would otherwise render
// "sb· · ..."). The current Wordmark does not end in the separator glyph,
// so this degrades to the standard " · " join — the check is
// capability-based (does Wordmark end in the glyph), not a hardcoded
// assumption about any one candidate's shape.
//
// Render never prints "%", "saved", or "savings" in any segment or
// fallback string — there is no comparison, no savings framing anywhere
// in this package's vocabulary (plan §4.2; render_test.go pins this as a
// negative assertion on every golden case).
