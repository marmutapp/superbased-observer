// Package dblease provides a flock-based, cross-process advisory lease so
// multiple independent `observer` processes (proxy, watcher, dashboard,
// backfill, or several daemons pointed at the same DB) don't each
// independently run the same heavy maintenance pass at once (T2.3,
// docs/plans/observer-disk-compute-remediation-plan-2026-08-26.md P1-F).
//
// It is deliberately narrow: one function, no retries, no queueing. A
// caller that fails to acquire a named lease is expected to skip its own
// pass for this round and let whichever process holds the lease do the
// work — never to wait or block, and never to treat a lease error as a
// reason not to proceed (fail-open; see [TryAcquire]'s doc comment).
//
// Pure-ish per the module boundary discipline (CLAUDE.md "Module
// Boundaries"): file I/O only, no database/sql, no net/http, no fsnotify.

// TryAcquire attempts to take a non-blocking, exclusive, cross-process
// advisory lease named name, backed by a lock file at
// filepath.Join(dir, name+".lock"). dir is typically the DB directory
// (filepath.Dir(cfg.Observer.DBPath)) — callers share one dir across
// however many differently-named leases they take (e.g. "db-maintenance",
// "retention", "codeintel-index"), each getting its own lock file so they
// don't contend with one another.
//
// On unix this is a real syscall.Flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB): a second
// TryAcquire for the same name — in this process or another — returns
// acquired=false while the first holder has it, and succeeds again once
// the first is released. Releasing is also automatic if the holding
// process exits or crashes (flock is held per open file description and
// the kernel drops it when the fd closes), so a lease can never be
// stranded held by a dead process. Off unix there is no portable
// non-blocking advisory-lock syscall wired here, so this degrades to
// always acquired=true (no cross-process coordination happens, but
// nothing is silently broken either — see [Available]).
//
// Fail-open by design: an error acquiring the lease (e.g. the lock
// directory can't be created) returns acquired=false with err set. It is
// NOT the same as "another process holds it" — callers must check err
// first and proceed with their own work on any error, never skip it. Only
// acquired=false with err==nil means "skip, someone else has this."
