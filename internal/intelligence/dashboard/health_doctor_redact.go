// Placeholder vocabulary for pathRedactor. These are the ONLY tokens it
// substitutes in, and they are deliberately readable rather than opaque: the
// whole point of substituting instead of dropping is that "hook_checksums.json
// under ~/.observer is stale" stays an actionable remediation hint after the
// machine's layout and the operator's identity have been taken out of it.
//
// "~" is the local home because that is the form the operator already reads in
// this project's own docs and config; a message that already said "~/.observer"
// and one that quoted the expanded path collapse to the same sentence, which is
// correct — they name the same directory.

// pathRedactor rewrites free text by replacing filesystem roots the server
// already holds with stable placeholders. It is the disclosure filter for
// GET /api/health/doctor's remote-facing projection.
//
// WHY SUBSTITUTION AND NOT A PATTERN. A regex that "looks like a path" is a
// heuristic predicate, and heuristic predicates in this codebase's filter
// layers have a documented history of failing in BOTH directions (docs/
// security.md H5/H5c/H6): they miss real paths and they mangle innocent text.
// The roots here are exact strings the process already knows — its own home,
// config file, database, executable, temp dir, and the cross-OS homes the
// crossmount bridge enumerates — so a match is a fact, not a guess. It also
// does not rot: a future doctor check that mentions the home directory is
// covered the day it lands, with no per-check allow-list to keep in sync.
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. Roots are applied LONGEST FIRST. Several of them nest
// (the config file and the database live under the home directory; the
// executable often does too), and applying the shorter root first would produce
// a mangled hybrid — "~/.observer/config.toml" where "<config>" was meant, or
// "<other-home> User" for a Windows home literally named "Default User".
//
// IT OVER-REDACTS RATHER THAN UNDER-REDACTS. Matching is plain substring, not
// path-component-anchored, so a root that happens to be a string prefix of an
// unrelated path is substituted too ("/tmp" inside "/tmpfs" becomes "<tmp>fs").
// That is the deliberate failure direction for a privacy filter: an
// over-redacted sentence is confusing, an under-redacted one is a disclosure.
//
// RESIDUE — WHAT THIS DOES NOT REMOVE. This is NOT complete redaction and must
// not be described as such anywhere:
//
//  1. A path under no known root. The redactor substitutes roots this process
//     holds; a hook config registered at /opt/other/observer, a project on a
//     second volume quoted by a transcript-reader error, or a database moved
//     outside the home directory are emitted verbatim. Observed, not
//     hypothetical — `hooks.binary` prints "registered=<that path>" for exactly
//     this case.
//  2. OS-convention system paths. /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json and
//     /etc/codex/*.toml appear in the native-console checks. They carry no
//     identity and no layout beyond the OS's own convention, so they are left
//     readable on purpose.
//  3. Non-path identity. The `org enrolment` check reports the enrolled user's
//     EMAIL, the org name/id and the org server URL. Substitution cannot touch
//     these — they are not paths — and they are left in place deliberately:
//     this endpoint is reachable only by a device the owner paired through a
//     local approval, and the owner's own enrolment readout is the legitimate
//     remote use of that check. Residue all the same, named here rather than
//     glossed over.
//  4. Everything, when no root resolves. With neither a home directory nor a
//     config path available the redactor is empty() and rewrites nothing.
