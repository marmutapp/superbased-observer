// set compiled into the binary (R1) plus, when enrolled, the org
// document the push loop already fetched and cached (R3). Rail order is
// release-then-org, which matters only for id collisions — Merge keeps
// the FIRST occurrence, so a release announcement wins a duplicate id
// and an org admin cannot overwrite one of ours by reusing its id.

// handleEnrolmentStatus does for org mode: no cache row, no error, no
// difference in the response shape.

// a retraction (empty body), or a body that fails to decode.
//
// Every failure here is silent on purpose. This is a banner: the honest

// trusted from the body. The server already refuses to sign anything
