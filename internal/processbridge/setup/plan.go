// TRIGGER CHOICE — /SC ONLOGON + /RL HIGHEST:
//   - ONLOGON, because the capturer is a long-lived daemon-shaped process that
//     must be running before the AI tools it observes are; it retries its
//     connection forever, so starting before the WSL daemon is harmless.
//   - /RL HIGHEST, because ETW session control (StartTraceW) ALWAYS requires
//     elevation — a non-elevated capturer gets ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED and falls
//     back to poll-only capture. A Task Scheduler task launched at HIGHEST
//     runs with the account's full token and shows NO UAC consent dialog,
//     which a Startup-folder shortcut cannot do.
//
// NO /RU, deliberately: schtasks creates the task in the context of the
// account that runs it, which under an elevated shell is the operator's own
// account — and it MUST be their own account, because the token file is
// commonly read over \\wsl.localhost, a per-user share that SYSTEM cannot
// reach. Passing /RU for another account also drags in /RP. The account the
// task must belong to is named in the notes instead.
//
// NO /F, deliberately: this command is only ever emitted when the task is
// ABSENT, and without /F schtasks refuses to clobber a task that appeared in
// the meantime. Updating an existing task is an explicit `/F` the operator
// types themselves.
//
// QUOTING — SINGLE quotes around the program path, and the reason is measured
// (2026-07-26, with a deliberately spaced C:\Program Files\… path):
//
//	/TR "\"<prog>\" args"   cmd.exe: OK   PowerShell: ERROR (Invalid argument/option - 'C:\Program')
//	/TR "'<prog>' args"     cmd.exe: OK   PowerShell: OK      ← what we emit
//	/TR "<prog> args"       stores an UNQUOTED program → Task Scheduler runs C:\Program
//
// schtasks itself normalizes the single-quoted program into the correct
// double-quoted stored action, so the "spaced path is one token" requirement is
// still satisfied. An elevated shell is as likely to be PowerShell (Windows
// Terminal's "Run as administrator") as cmd.exe, and this is the only form that
// parses in both — do NOT "fix" it back to backslash escapes.
//
// THE ONE PATH THE SINGLE-QUOTED FORM CANNOT CARRY is one containing a single
// quote — `C:\Users\O'Brien\observer.exe` is an ordinary, legal Windows path.
// Wrapping it in single quotes ends the quoted program at the apostrophe, and
// schtasks stores a program that is a PREFIX of the real one: a task that runs
// the wrong thing, silently, with no error at registration time. Such a path
// therefore falls back to the same `\"…\"` escaped form the spaced token path
// uses (cmdOnly=true) — correct in cmd.exe and in the broker, at the cost of
// the PowerShell paste. See quoteTaskProgram.
//
// The --token-file value carries no inner quotes for the same reason: the only
// form that survives both shells is a bare path, and bare is correct for every
// path without a space. cmdOnly=true is returned when the token path DOES
// contain a space, where correctness forces the cmd.exe-only escaped form and
// the caller must say so rather than hand a PowerShell user a broken line. An
// apostrophe needs nothing there — the token is an ARGUMENT, where a quote is
// not the grouping character schtasks looks at.

//
// WHY A BROKER EXISTS AT ALL. §W4.1 measured that `schtasks /Create` is
// Access-denied from WSL's interop token (Medium Mandatory Level,
// BUILTIN\Administrators present "for deny only"), which is why PlanTask never
// creates the task. What that measurement rules out is taking elevation
// SILENTLY; it does not rule out asking for it. Measured on the reference host
// 2026-07-27: a `Start-Process -Verb RunAs` from that same WSL token yields
// `Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level` once the operator approves the prompt,
// and `schtasks /Create /SC ONLOGON /RL HIGHEST` under it exits 0. This is the
// exact analogue of `sudo tailscale set --operator` — a consent step Observer
// cannot take for the user, only put in front of them.
//
// UAC IS NOT SUPPRESSED AND CANNOT BE. No flag, manifest or argument skips the
// consent dialog for a medium-integrity caller; the dialog IS the security
// boundary. The script therefore treats a dismissed prompt as a first-class
// outcome: Start-Process throws, the catch prints what Windows actually said,
// and the process exits non-zero — so the card falls back to the copyable
// command instead of spinning. On a headless host with no interactive desktop
// session the same path is taken (nothing can approve the prompt), which is
// why the failure text points at the manual command rather than retrying.
//
// WHY THE ARGS ARE ONE STRING, NOT AN ARRAY. PowerShell's
// `Start-Process -ArgumentList` joins an array with single spaces and adds NO
// quoting, so an array would silently destroy the /TR grouping that the whole
// §W4.2 measurement is about. A single string is assigned verbatim to the
// child's command line. Measured 2026-07-27 end to end (WSL exec → interop →
// PowerShell 5.1 → child process): the child receives the argument string
// BYTE-IDENTICAL, for the single-quoted form AND for the cmd-shell-only `\"`
// form TaskArgs emits when the token path contains a space. No shell parses
// the string on the way, so cmdOnly does not apply to this path — it is a
