// ObsSink is the optional "gateway rail" seam (Plane-A general observability
// — docs/observability.md "proxy turn (automatic)"): when non-nil on
// [Options], the proxy hands it one ChatTurnFacts per SUCCESSFULLY inserted
// api_turns row whose request arrived on an explicit /up/<id> upstream lane
// (success or error turns — a co-resident hosted app such as Open WebUI that
// routes through /up/<id> without ever emitting its own OTLP), so it can
// synthesize an obs_traces/obs_spans "chat.turn"/"chat.completions" pair.
// That makes the turn show up in the org Trajectory explorer with zero app
// instrumentation. Default provider lanes (Plane-B coding agents) NEVER
// reach this sink — see obsLaneCtxKey.
//
// Bound at the obs wiring point (cmd/observer/obs_wire.go) so internal/proxy
// never imports internal/obs — the reverse-import boundary
// (tests/invariant/obs_boundary_test.go). nil ⇒ disabled, zero overhead
// beyond a nil check.
//
// SynthesizeChatTurn is called FIRE-AND-FORGET: p.synthesizeObsTrace spawns
// it on its own goroutine, AFTER the client already has its response bytes
// and the api_turn insert has completed, on its own detached context
// (mirrors the insertTurnDetached / captureProcessNetwork precedent). The
// response path never waits on it — a slow or hung sink cannot add latency
// to the handler, only to how promptly its own trace appears. It is
// fail-open in two ways: a panic inside the call is recovered (never crashes
// the proxy) and a returned error is logged at DEBUG and never surfaces to
// the caller or affects the turn that was already durably recorded.

// ObsContentExtractor is the optional seam that closes the gateway-rail
// content-truncation class (trajectory-ui-rollup-and-spandetail-fixes spec,
// Lane B): when [Options].ObsContentExtractor is non-nil, synthesizeObsTrace
// calls it SYNCHRONOUSLY, on the request-handling path, AFTER the client
// already has its response bytes — over the FULL, uncopied reqBody/respBody
// (never the 64 KiB obsClipBody/obsClipResponseBody prefix/tail those
// helpers exist for in the no-extractor fallback path). Extracting from the
// full bodies at the source fixes the truncation class outright: a tail-clip
// of a long SSE stream loses the response's HEAD (a live capture started
// mid-sentence); a head-clip of a >64 KiB request body cuts mid-JSON and
// drops the prompt entirely.
//
// Implementations MUST return bounded strings (the cmd/observer wiring
// returns text already clipped to its own content-clip bound) — the caller
// treats the return values as ready to store, not as raw bodies to clip
// again. Either return value may be "" when nothing could be extracted
// (unparseable/absent body) — never an error; a body this seam can't make
// sense of simply yields no content, exactly like the legacy path.
//
// Bound at the obs wiring point (cmd/observer/obs_wire.go), same as ObsSink
// — internal/proxy must never import internal/obs or any cmd/observer code
// (the reverse-import boundary, tests/invariant/obs_boundary_test.go). nil
// (the default) leaves synthesizeObsTrace's behavior byte-identical to
// before this seam existed: bodies are clipped by obsClipBody/
// obsClipResponseBody and handed across on ChatTurnFacts.Request/ResponseBody
// for the sink to extract from itself.

// arrived via an explicit /up/<id> lane — the lane a co-resident hosted app
// (Open WebUI → /up/openrouter) is pointed at. The default provider lanes
// (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, codex base_url, gemini) carry Plane-B coding-agent
// traffic, which already has its own rail (api_turns → sessions →
// coding-agent org rollups) and must NEVER appear in the Hosted Apps
// Trajectory explorer. A coding agent deliberately routed through a /up/
// lane (hermes → OpenRouter) is the documented residual — see

// ChatTurnFacts is the plain, obs-type-free projection of one proxied LLM

// forces an edit on the obs side of the reverse-import boundary, and no
// models.APITurn (or obs type) crosses this seam undeclared.
//
// RequestBody/ResponseBody carry the RAW upstream HTTP bodies (whatever
// shape captureNetwork already captured for this call — Anthropic Messages
// API or OpenAI Chat Completions, success or error) so the sink can

// OTLP ingest path does. This is plain bytes, not obs types — the sink is
// responsible for parsing, extracting, gating (its node's content posture),
// and bounding what it persists; a parse failure must never fail the turn.
// May be nil (e.g. a body-less call site, or bodies the caller chose not to
// thread through) — the sink must tolerate that and simply capture nothing.
