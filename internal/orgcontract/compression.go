// CompressionStatRow is the W3.5 compression-savings/eviction wire row: one
// row per (day, mechanism) bucket, mirroring the node dashboard's Compression
// page (web/src/pages/Compression.tsx) and its /api/compression/* read-side
// (internal/intelligence/dashboard/dashboard.go::handleCompressionEvents /
// handleCompressionByModel), which both read the node-local compression_events
// table (migration internal/db/migrations/009_compression_events.sql). This is
// the confirmed durable backing store — compression figures are NOT computed
// purely in-memory; every row aggregated here already exists as a persisted
// SQLite row on the node.
//
// Content-free: mechanism name + byte/event counts only. No message text, no
// file path, no tool-call content, no importance score, no body hash — those
// stay node-local (compression_events carries msg_index/importance_score/
// body_hash for the node's own dashboard drill-down; none of that crosses).
//
// HONESTY RULE (see memory feedback_compression_savings_history: a prior
// compression-savings claim was RETRACTED after being measured at +60% cost —
// never ship a projected/marketed savings number, only a measured delta from
// the node's own store). This row enforces that at aggregation time, not by
// convention:
//
//   - For a genuinely compressing mechanism (json/code/logs/text/diff/html/
//     stash/read_cache/tools/rolling_summary/code_collapse/...), compressed_bytes
//     is a REAL retained size, so SavedBytes = OriginalBytes - CompressedBytes
//     is a real, measured byte saving. SavedTokensEst applies the same
//     chars-per-token heuristic (bytes/4) the node's own handleCompressionEvents
//     uses, and is explicitly an ESTIMATE (the field name says so).
//   - For the lossy "drop" mechanism, the message is EVICTED outright —
//     compressed_bytes is 0 by construction and the content is gone, not
//     retained smaller. Pricing that as "savings" would misrepresent lossy
//     eviction as compression savings, the same misleading class as the
//     retracted claim. This row keeps eviction in a SEPARATE field
//     (EvictedBytes) with SavedBytes/SavedTokensEst forced to 0, and marks
//     Lossy=true so the org UI can never conflate the two even if it tries.
//
// The lossy/non-lossy classification mirrors
// internal/intelligence/dashboard/compression_mechanism.go::mechanismIsLossy
// exactly (currently just {"drop": true}). It is DUPLICATED, not imported: the
// dashboard package is an HTTP-layer package and internal/store (the row
// builder for this type) must not import it (CLAUDE.md module-boundary
// discipline — a domain/store package importing an HTTP handler package is a
// smell, and the dependency would also point the wrong direction). See
// internal/store/compressionorgrows.go for the duplicated copy and its
// pointer back to the canonical source.
