// sandbox, read from the OBSERVER_SANDBOX marker its parent (the sandboxed
// `observer <verb>` child, itself inside the bwrap boundary) exported. Hooks
// are spawned by the AI tool ITSELF, inside the boundary, so they inherit the
// marker and this self-report is truthful; the proxy lane (the daemon,
// outside any boundary) never sets it, so proxy-sourced events stay
// unstamped (Sandboxed=false, an honest zero — spec §6 observability
// posture). sandbox.EnvMarker is the single owner of the wire constant.
